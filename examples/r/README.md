# R
R is a language for statistical processing and graphics, so it has great facilities for those things. It is used by data scientists when exploring data. The main alternative to R is Python, but with Julia starting to make an entrance.

If you want to run R locally, you need to [install it](https://www.r-project.org/)

## How to build and run
You probably just want to run it interactively, just type `R` in the terminal. To run the provided script, you can either write `source("aoc.R")` in the interactive R session, or type `Rscript aoc.R` in the terminal. Before that, you will need to do the same (once) for "install.R" so that the purrr library gets downloaded.

## Docker
According to the [Cygni AoC procedure](https://github.com/cygni/aoc_example)
