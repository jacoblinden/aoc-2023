# Coffeescript
The 1.0 version of [Coffeescript](https://coffeescript.org/) was released in 2010 as an enhanced
alternative to Javascript (which was still very clunky at that time). Coffeescript took 
inspiration from Ruby, Python and Haskell to make a very nice language. 

Now, in 2021, most of the strengths and features in Coffeescript has made it into Javascript 
proper, making Coffeescript less relevant, and probably not recommended for production use. 
Still, it's a fun language to play around with.

To install it locally, run `npm install --global coffeescript` (You obviously need npm first, it is readily available e.g. via homebrew)

## How to build and run
In your terminal, type `coffee index.coffee`

## Docker
According to the [Cygni AoC procedure](https://github.com/cygni/aoc_example)
